1 Obtain the elements of the union between two character vectors

     vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
     vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))

Answer: vec_union <- c(vec1,vec2)

2 Get those elements that are common to both vectors.
    
Answer: vec_intersect <- intersect(vec1, vec2)

3 Get the difference of the elements between two character vectors

Answer: vec12 <- setdiff(vec1, vec2)
vec21 <- setdiff(vec2, vec1)
